Project Aim:
To design and develop a predictive visual analytics dashboard that identifies students at risk of academic underperformance by comparing current semester performance against historical data, enabling lecturers to provide timely intervention and support.

Objective
1. The objective of the project is to integrate and preprocess multisource academic data into a single, structured dataset so that it can be analyzed accurately and meaningfully.
2. To develop a real-time visual performance analysis dashboard that displays key student information, such as academic performance, attendance patterns, and risk indicators to support effective monitoring by academic staff.
3. To implement predictive machine learning models that identify the key factors influencing student performance and accurately detect students who may require early academic intervention.
4. To evaluate the usability and effectiveness of both the dashboard and the analytical model to ensure the system is user-friendly, practical, and supportive of informed academic decision-making.

4.4 Data Understanding → you may take it from IR and improve your data understanding
discussions
 Data Understanding – perform all data understanding steps for your dataset with any
preferred tools.
4.4.1 Variables – explain variables in your dataset
4.4.2 Observations – explain observations in your dataset
4.4.3 Histogram – create histograms or any other visualizations to understand further
your dataset.
4.4.4 Etc – add any other necessary sections for your ‘data understanding’ phase.
Note: Perform data understanding and data pre-processing with any preferred tools.
